### Hello world! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm Annie, a dedicated Data Scientist based in the Bay Area. Welcome to my GitHub page!

🌟 I'm currently developing data science and engineering course materials, aiming to bridge theoretical concepts with practical applications to enhance learning and understanding.

📚 I hold a Master’s Degree in Data Science from the University of San Francisco and had practical experience from working in the supply chain and e-commerce industries.

🤝 I am always open to collaboration and would love to work together on exciting projects. Feel free to contribute through pull requests on my repositories or reach out for potential collaborations!
